# üì¶ Inventory Notifications Microservice

**Project Based Learning ‚Äì Part 1**

Give me the software requirements for a microservice you would like me to build for an existing architecture (again, make up any necessary details). I will use this to do more project-based learning."_

**Subject:** Software Requirements ‚Äì Inventory Notifications Microservice
**Date:** June 19, 2025

## üì¶ Project Background

NovaLoop Technologies is building a **modular, cloud-native e-commerce platform** for mid-sized retail clients. Our backend architecture includes:

- Microservices deployed in **Kubernetes**
- Services in **Go** and **Node.js**
- **RabbitMQ** for messaging
- **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage
- **Redis** for caching
- Inter-service communication using **gRPC** and **REST**

Currently, the system lacks a centralized way to handle inventory threshold events. We need a new microservice to monitor inventory levels and notify internal and external systems when critical thresholds are crossed.

---

## üß© Your Assignment: `inventory-events-service`

You are to build a microservice that:

- Subscribes to inventory updates from the `inventory-service`
- Detects when inventory crosses critical thresholds:
  - **Low Stock**
  - **Out of Stock**
  - **Back In Stock**
- Publishes events to a RabbitMQ topic
- Logs these events in PostgreSQL
- Provides an internal API for event auditing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### üî§ Language & Frameworks

- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **REST (if applicable):** [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) or [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- **gRPC (if applicable):** [grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go)
- **ORM:** [gorm](https://gorm.io/) or `pgx` with raw SQL

### üì® Messaging (RabbitMQ)

- **Broker:** RabbitMQ (AMQP 0.9.1)
- **Input Queue:** `inventory.updates`
- **Output Topic:** `inventory.events`

### üóÉÔ∏è Database (PostgreSQL)

Use the internal `postgres-service`. Suggested schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE inventory_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id UUID NOT NULL,
    previous_quantity INTEGER,
    new_quantity INTEGER,
    event_type TEXT, -- 'LOW_STOCK', 'OUT_OF_STOCK', 'BACK_IN_STOCK'
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
